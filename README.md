#  pedestrian-evacuation-visualization-unreal

An Unreal-based visualization tool for pedestrian evacuation, David Bueno, 2024

## Description

This tool uses the [simulation traces](https://github.com/Bio4Res/pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton-trace) produced by [our simulation tool](https://github.com/Bio4Res/pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton) and provides a configurable 3D visualization of the evacuation process, allowing the user to focus on specific parts of the environment or on specific pedestrians.
